## Trace-X is a system for tracking parts along the supply chain.
#### A high level of transparency across the supplier network enables faster intervention based on a recorded event in the supply chain. This saves costs by seamlessly tracking parts and creates trust through clearly defined and secure data access by the companies and persons involved in the process.

## How to contribute

A detailed guide on how to contribute can be found [here](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releasing
Here is our [Releasing guide](/docs/RELEASE.md).

## The frontend application

This application serves as a user entry point to the Catena-X network.

It's written in Typescript based on the `Angular` framework.
We decided on using Angular because of two important aspects.
Firstly, Angular comes with `strict guidelines`, which makes it harder to start working on for new developers, but for established developers it is `easy to start working with`.
Secondly, Angular `scales` perfectly in the long run. Because of the restricted possibilities and strict guidelines it is hard to implement multiple solutions for the same problem. e.g. Storing data or routing.
With that in mind it made sense it chose Angular for an `open source` project.

Source files are exposed statically through the NGINX web server.

### Challenges and solutions

"Visualisation of traceability" is one of our most important feature, but once was one of our biggest problems.
We wanted to achieve something that is `visually pleasing`, is `easy to use` and `performs` very good in a `browser application`.
Our first approach was to use HTML canvas. But it turned out it is hard to perform accurate actions inside a canvas. That is why we decided on using the [D3 library](https://d3js.org/).
D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS.
Because it uses SVGs, we knew it will perform great. And we are able to have pinpoint accuracy when it comes to user actions.

### Frontend Prerequisites

* [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
* [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Frontend Installation

* see [Installation guide](/frontend/INSTALL.md)

### Getting started

Clone the source locally:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:Cofinity-X/cofinity-x-ba-traceability-foss.git
$ cd cofinity-x-ba-traceability-foss/frontend
```

Install prerequisites:
1. install [Node.js 18.x](https://nodejs.org)
```sh
$ npm install --global yarn
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
$ yarn install
```

Start application with``yarn start`` and navigate to http://localhost:4200.

### Application authentication

Please find [here](/frontend/AUTHENTICATION.md) some important information about the app authentication.

### Application architecture & patterns

This [architecture](/frontend/ARCHITECTURE.md) gives you a roadmap and best practices to follow when building an application
so that you end up with a well-structured app.

### User guide

A detailed [explanation](/docs/src/docs/user/user-manual.adoc) of how to use the application.

## The backend application

### Backend Prerequisites

* [JDK 17](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html)
* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)

### Backend Installation

* see [Installation guide](/tx-backend/INSTALL.md)

### Running tests

#### Unit tests

To run unit tests invoke following command:

```sh
mvn clean test
```

#### Integration tests

Product Traceability FOSS Backend relies on [Testcontainers library](https://www.testcontainers.org/) in order to provide
persistence layer, thus [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) is required to be running.

To run integration tests via command line, invoke following command:

```shell
mvn -pl tx-models,tx-backend,tx-coverage -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.apache.maven.cli.transfer.Slf4jMavenTransferListener=warn verify
```

#### Running all tests

To run all tests invoke following command:

```sh
mvn -DskipTests=false clean verify
```

*Please note that this task depends on `integrationTest` task, so it's required to have [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) running.*

## API documentation
The project follows [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) in order to document implemented REST Endpoints. The documentation can be found under [/openapi directory](/tx-backend/openapi/traceability-foss-backend.json)
or can be viewed in the Swagger UI accessing the url: `{projectBasePath}/api/swagger-ui/index.html`
